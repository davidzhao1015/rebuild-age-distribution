# **🧠 Meta-Analysis of Symptom Onset Age**

This repository provides a **practical workflow** for estimating **symptom onset age distributions** of autoimmune disorders using data extracted from **published literature**.

Because **individual patient data (IPD)** are rarely available, the workflow focuses on working with **summary statistics**—like mean, median, IQR, quantiles, and min–max values—to reconstruct realistic distributions that can be used for further analysis or modeling.

---

## **🌟 What This Project Does**

- Reconstructs **onset age distributions** from different types of reported summary statistics.
- Deals with **heterogeneous reporting formats** (e.g., some studies report median/IQR, others only mean ± SD).
- Runs **sensitivity analyses** to understand how assumptions affect the results.
- Optimizes parameters to better handle **“fat tails”** (e.g., rare late-onset cases).
- Helps make study results **more comparable and usable** for downstream modeling.

2. **02_sensitivity_analysis.ipynb**
    
    Explore how different assumptions and input ranges affect the reconstructed distributions.
    
3. **03_fat_tail_optimization.ipynb**
    
    Fine-tune distribution parameters to better capture long tails in the data.

## **📌 Tips & Notes**

- The workflow is designed for **summary-level data** — no individual patient data required.
- You can easily adjust **distribution assumptions** (e.g., log-normal, gamma) inside the notebooks.
- Visual outputs are included to **check the shape and fit** of reconstructed distributions.
- Sensitivity analyses help you understand the **range of plausible distributions**.
