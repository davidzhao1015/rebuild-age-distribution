To conduct a meta-analysis on the symptom onset age of an autoimmune disorder using published literature, focusing on robust statistical methods to simulate onset age distributions. 

The analysis will accommodate varying types of available summary statistics (e.g., mean, median, IQR, quantiles, minâ€“max), acknowledging that individual patient data (IPD) are rarely accessible. 

The goal is to generate reliable, comparable age distributions across studies despite heterogeneous reporting formats.

The repository includes three notebooks:

1. **Constructing onset age distribution from summary statistics**
2. **Performing sensitivity analysis**
3. **Optimizing parameters for "fat" tails**

The first notebook has an associated blog [article](https://davidzhao1015.github.io/blog/2025/reconstruct-age-distribution/)
